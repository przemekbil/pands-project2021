The Fisher’s Iris data set comes from the 1936 R. A. Fisher paper “The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems”. In this paper, the author tackles the problem on how to distinguish between 3 different species of Iris flowers using the measurements of their 4 characteristics (Petal’s and Sepals length and width). The method used in this paper focused on finding a linear function of the four measurements that would maximize the ratio of the difference between the means to the standard deviations within species.
